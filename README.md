# It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia RPG
>An RPG with music and sound effects featuring the main characters of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, made with HTML/CSS and JavaScript, using jQuery DOM traversal and manipulation.

## Let's show these Jabronis what's what.
>You got beef? Play as one of the jabronis from Paddy's Pub and squash that beef one attack at a time. Each character has their own weak and strong attacks, which reduce opponents' HP by a randomized value. Once your opponent's HP reaches zero, your character levels up.
